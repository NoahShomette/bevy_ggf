### Networking

Ultimately the framework should support networking. Unfortunately building this currently is to much for me to handle by
myself along with actually building out the rest of the framework. If you are interested or have any design
recommendations that would make networking easier in the future, please open an issue and fill me in on it!

#### Networking Requirements

- Cross platform support (Web, Windows, Mac, Linux)
    - The framework should make every effort *not* to limit anyone using it. Instead it should give more functionality
      and
      ease development. If Networking was to be added then it must be cross platform then.
