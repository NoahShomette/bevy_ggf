Bevy_GGFs goals are to make creating grid based games easier.

With that being said, the underlying goals are to create an easily used yet extensible ecosystem of systems to enable as
many different types of grid based games as possible.
Initially the design goal is to actively support Advance Wars style games, however that should not be construed to lock
the framework into that one type of game.
